<h1>Hello World, I’m Rafael Bira!</h1>
<br>
<h2>About me</h2>
  🔍 I am a very curious, self-taught person and I learn very easily.<br>
  📖 I also consider myself a person with wide general culture, creative and committed.<br>
  💡 I like to be methodical, organized and face challenges that drive me to improve every day.<br>

<h2>My interests</h2>
  Besides coding, my other passions are reading, writing and music 📚📝🎵. By the way, as you can see in my profile picture, I'm a bassist too! 🎸 I love making music and listening to different genres from all over the world, always under the light of the jazz philosophy.<br>
  Another thing that triggers my curiosity is learning about other languages (not IT) and cultures. 🌐 That's why I'm trying to learn German and French, for example. Personally I believe that this way you can better communicate and understand people, their mindsets and ways of thinking. That's for sure a marvelous thing!
